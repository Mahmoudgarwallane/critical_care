Accelerated by COVID-19, Critical Care was borne out of the need to facilitate information between healthcare professionals and patients to discern what signals and symptoms relate to underlying causes. Critical Care empowers these users with a platform for real-time monitoring, remote care and self-learning insights. Doctors and nurses can interact and monitor realtime their patients and administer care remotely - in doing so, they map realtime-data against current medical records, training a platform for unprecedented data-driven health research.
