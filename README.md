COVID exacerbates an issue that existed long before this pandemic - the misunderstanding of design resolution. At each layer of design - the device, application, and organizational layers - the current tools are ill-suited for generation and consumption of data-driven research, an issue which has prevented us from leveraging our best tools to learn about disease and it's underlying causes.



Through a redesign of the data experience, data interfaces (DX/DI), Critical Care empowers healthcare workers with a platform for real-time monitoring, remote care and self-learning insights. Doctors can see realtime their patients and administer care remotely. In doing so, they map realtime-data against current medical records, training a platform for unprecedented data-driven health research


Designed with Flutter and ðŸ’™BLoC

## Self-learning Insights
By correlating real-time data to medical records, the users train a dataset that can revolutionize heath AI
